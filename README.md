   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Simsalagin/maps-button-for-google-search.git
   cd maps-button-for-google-search

## Usage

1. Visit [Google](https://www.google.com) and search for a location (e.g., "Eiffel Tower, Paris" or "restaurants near me")

2. When Google displays map results, you'll see a blue "Open in Google Maps" button:

   - In the right-side business knowledge panel (when viewing business information)

3. Click the button to open the location directly in Google Maps with the business name and address automatically filled in

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Google Chrome or any Chromium-based browser
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and CSS

### Making Changes

1. Edit the source files as needed:
   - `manifest.json` - Extension configuration
   - `content.js` - Main logic for detecting maps and adding buttons
   - `styles.css` - Button styling

2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` and click the reload icon for the extension

3. Test your changes on a Google Search page

### Debugging

- Open Chrome DevTools (F12) on a Google Search page
- Check the Console tab for log messages
- The extension logs when it activates and detects maps

### Building for Chrome Web Store

To package the extension for Chrome Web Store submission, you have two options:

#### Using npm (recommended):

```bash
npm run build
```

#### Using build.sh directly:

```bash
./build.sh
```

Or if you need to make it executable first:

```bash
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

Both methods will create `maps-button-for-google-search.zip` ready for upload to the Chrome Web Store.

The build script automatically:
- Cleans up any previous build artifacts
- Packages only necessary files (manifest, scripts, styles, icons)
- Excludes development files and system artifacts (.DS_Store)
- Creates a properly formatted ZIP file
- Displays the package size and contents for verification

## Privacy

This extension:
- Does NOT collect any user data
- Does NOT track your searches
- Does NOT make external network requests
- Only reads the search query from the current page URL
- Requires no special permissions
